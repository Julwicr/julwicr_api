This first feature of the API is accessible at https://julwicrapi.herokuapp.com/api/v1/longest_words <br>
To create a game: POST to https://julwicrapi.herokuapp.com/api/v1/longest_words
<br>
To get a grid of 10 letters: GET https://julwicrapi.herokuapp.com/api/v1/longest_words/new
<br>
It is a game where you have to find a word in a given grid. I adapted a challenge from Le Wagon to have access to it as an API and then implement it on my website. <br>
You can play here: https://www.julienrolland.net/miscellaneous <br>
More to come.
